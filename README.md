# Annotated Research Contexts specification

Annotated Research Contexts (ARCs) are designed to represent FAIR Digital Objects (FDOs) for plant sciences to facilitate encompassing Research Data Management (RDM) tasks.

The [ARC-specification](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/ARC-specfication/blob/main/ARC%20specification.md) provides a detailed description of the technical requirements to form the basis for the operational characteristics.

Please provide feedback via GitHub issues. For small extensions or fixes please use pull requests.
If you have novel conceptual ideas, please discuss them with the community under [discussion](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/ARC-specfication/discussions).

We are planning to remove the -RFC (from the version string) and release version 1.0 on 01. April 2022
